                <p>
                    A privacy breach occurs when there is unauthorized access to or collection, use, disclosure or disposal of
                    personal information. You will be notified about data breaches when Ibuki Training believes you are likely

                    or harm to your mental or physical well-being. In the event that Ibuki Training becomes aware of a security
                    breach which has resulted or may result in unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information
                    Ibuki Training will promptly investigate the matter and notify the applicable Supervisory Authority not
                    later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result
